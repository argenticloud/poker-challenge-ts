# Argenti - Typescript Poker Challenge

This is the scaffold project for Argenti's poker challenge.
Use this template to get you up and running for the Argenti challenge, then make changes to the `src/` directory
to have a functioning solution based on our given instructions.

## Project structure

All the relevant code sits in `src/`. An `index.ts` is already present, but there is no limit to writing all your code inside or outside of it. All Jest tests should sit in the `__tests__` folder, and the naming convention requires that the filename includes `.spec` or `.test`, otherwise it will not be picked up.

This project also has prettier and eslint set up, making sure that those are both passing will be beneficial to your challenge's review. At the end of this file, you will find links to VSCode extensions that help automatically run Prettier and ESLint whilst you write code.

## Input file

The input file you are required to read is available in `bin/poker-hands.txt`. Make sure your program can read the file from that location.

## Running the code

To run the code whilst developing, use the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Testing the code

To run the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) unit test, use the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```
